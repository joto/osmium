         * The THandler template parameter of this class (and child classes)
         * names a policy class on which methods will be called. The class
         * should implement one or more of the following functions:
         *
         * - init(Osmium::OSM::Meta&)
         * - before_nodes/ways/relations()
         * - node/way/relation(Osmium::OSM::Node/Way/Relation*)
         * - after_nodes/ways/relations()
         * - final()
         * - area(Osmium::OSM::Area*)
         *
         * init() will be called before all others, final()
         * after all others.
         *
         * For every object node(), way(), or
         * relation() will be called, respectively.
         *
         * When there are several objects of the same type in a row the
         * before_*() function will be called before them and the
         * after_*() function after them. If your input file is
         * sorted as OSM files normally are, i.e. all nodes, then all ways,
         * then all relations, this will call before_nodes() once,
         * then for all the nodes node(), then after_nodes(),
         * then before_ways(), and so on.
         * This will also work properly if the input file contains, say, first
         * all relations, than all ways and then all nodes.
         *
         * But if you have nodes, ways, and relations intermixed in an input
         * file these handlers will probably not called in a useful way for you.
         * You can use osmosis --sort to sort your input file first.
         *
         * The method area() is special. It will only be called if
         * you have the multipolygon handler before your handler. There are no
         * before/after_areas() methods. Use init() and
         * final() instead.
