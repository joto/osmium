         * The THandler template parameter of this class (and child classes)
         * names a class on which callbacks will be called. The class should
         * implement one or more of the following functions:
         *
         * - callback_init()
         * - callback_before_nodes/ways/relations()
         * - callback_node/way/relation(Osmium::OSM::Node/Way/Relation *)
         * - callback_after_nodes/ways/relations()
         * - callback_final()
         * - callback_multipolygon(Osmium::OSM::Multipolygon *)
         *
         * callback_init() will be called before all others, callback_final()
         * after all others.
         *
         * For every object callback_node(), callback_way(), or
         * callback_relation() will be called, respectively.
         *
         * When there are several objects of the same type in a row the
         * callback_before_*() function will be called before them and the
         * callback_after_*() function after them. If your input file is
         * sorted as OSM files normally are, i.e. all nodes, then all ways,
         * then all relations, this will call callback_before_nodes() once,
         * then for all the nodes callback_node(), then callback_after_nodes(),
         * then callback_before_ways(), and so on.
         * This will also work properly if the input file contains, say, first
         * all relations, than all ways and then all nodes.
         *
         * But if you have nodes, ways, and relations intermixed in an input
         * file these handlers will probably not called in a useful way for you.
         * You can use osmosis --sort to sort your input file first.
         *
         * The callback_multipolygon() is special. It will only be called if
         * you have the multipolygon handler before your handler. There are no
         * before/after_multipolygons() callbacks. Use callback_init() and
         * callback_final() instead.
