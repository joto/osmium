Osmjs README
============

Osmjs is an Osmium based framework for handling OSM data by calling Javascript
callbacks for each object in an OSM data file. This gives you the flexibility
of Javascript together with speed of the C++ Osmium framework and the Google V8
Javascript JIT compiler.


Multipolygon Support
--------------------

Osmjs can assemble multipolygons from relations for you. To enable this you
have to use the --2pass/-2 option on the command line. The input file is then
read twice. In the first pass all relations of type=multipolygon or type=border
are stored in memory, together with the list of ways that are needed to build
them. In the second pass multipolygons are assembled from the ways. You will
get callbacks for each multipolygon as soon as all ways needed for a
multipolygon have gone by and the multipolygon could be assembled. You will
also get multipolygon callbacks for closed ways that are not needed for any
multipolygon as they potentially describe polygons, too.

Unless you give the --no-repair/-r option, Osmium will try to repair broken
multipolygons. It can sometimes close open rings and work around
self-intersecting rings.


Building osmjs
---------------

You must have the prerequisites for Osmium installed. See ../README.

Call "make" in this directory to build osmjs.


Calling osmjs
-------------

osmjs [OPTIONS] OSMFILE

OSMFILE can be an OSM XML (suffix .osm) (optionally packed with bz2 or gz) or
PBF (suffix .osm.pbf) file. In single-pass mode it can also be '-' to read a
PBF file from stdin.

See osmjs --help for the options. You must at least give the --javascript/-j
option with a javascript filename.

You need to use the --location-store/-l option if you want way and/or
multipolygon geometries. This can take a lot of memory! See "osmjs --help" for
more info.


Note for 32 bit systems
-----------------------

Osmjs has not been fully tested on 32 bit systems.
The -l array and -l disk options will not work on 32bit systems, because
the memory range they can address is just too small.


Javascript Functions
--------------------

You can use any normal Javascript functions and objects in your code.
Note that there is no DOM, you are not in a browser!

The following special functions have been defined:

* print(text)       -- Output any text to stdout
* include(filename) -- Include external Javascript file

In addition the "Osmium" object gives you access to some functionality:

* Osmium.debug            -- Boolean attribute reflecting the setting
                             of the --debug/-d command line option
* Osmium.Callbacks        -- To set the callback handlers (see below)
* Osmium.Output.CSV       -- CSV output files (see below)
* Osmium.Output.Shapefile -- Shapefile output files (see below)


Callbacks
---------

The following callbacks can be defined:
    Osmium.Callbacks.init
    Osmium.Callbacks.before_nodes
    Osmium.Callbacks.node
    Osmium.Callbacks.after_nodes
    Osmium.Callbacks.before_ways
    Osmium.Callbacks.way
    Osmium.Callbacks.after_ways
    Osmium.Callbacks.before_relations
    Osmium.Callbacks.relation
    Osmium.Callbacks.after_relations
    Osmium.Callbacks.area
    Osmium.Callbacks.end

If the --2pass/-2 option is *not* given, the callbacks are called in the
following order: init, before_nodes, node (for each node), after_nodes,
before_ways, way (for each way), after_ways, before_relations, relation (for
each relation), after_relations, end. The 'area' callback is never
called!

If the --2pass/-2 option is given, the callbacks are called in the following
order: init, before_nodes, node (for each node), after_nodes, before_ways,
way (for each way) / area (for each completed multipolygon), after_ways,
before_relations, relation (for each relation), after_relations, end. The
way and area callbacks can come in any order.

The 'node', 'way', 'relation' and 'area' callbacks will be called
with an OSM object as 'this'.

Objects have the following attributes: id, version, timestamp, uid, user,
changeset, and tags. 'tags' is a hash. Node objects also have lon and lat
attributes.

Example:
    Osmium.Callbacks.node = function() {
        print('node ' + this.id + ' ' + this.version + ' ' + this.timestamp + ' '
                    + this.uid + ' ' + this.user + ' '
                    + this.changeset + ' ' + this.lon + ' ' + this.lat);
        for (key in this.tags) {
            print(' ' + key + '=' + this.tags[key]);
        }
    }

Writing to CSV Files
--------------------

You can write some output to CSV files. Currently line endings are always LF,
column separator is always a TAB.

Example:
    var csv_file = Osmium.Output.CSV.open("some-filename.csv");
    csv_file.print("first column", "second column");
    csv_file.close();


Writing to Shapefiles
---------------------

(See next chapter for an easier way.)

You can write OSM objects to Shapefiles of type POINT, LINE, and POLYGON. To
do this you first have to open a shapefile and define the attributes that
should be used.

Do not give any suffix for the filename. The suffixes '.shp', '.shx', and
'.dbf' for the different files will be added automatically.

Define a shapefile named "example" with point geometries:
    var shp = Osmium.Output.Shapefile.open("example", "point");
    shp.add_field("id", "string", 12);
    shp.add_field("name", "string", 40);

Field types are integer, string, double, and bool. Bools are always of length
1, other need the length in characters and doubles also need a precision.

You can now add gemetries to the Shapefile:
    shp.add(some_node.geom, { id: some_node.id, some_node.tags.name });

The geometry of the object (in this case 'some_node') will be put into the
shapefile. The second argument to add() is a hash which must contain all
the attributes.

After use you have to close the shapefile properly or some data may not end
up in it:

shp.close();


Converting OSM data to Shapefiles
---------------------------------

There is an easier way to work with Shapefiles. If you include the osm2shp
Javascript library from the command line, you can use a different syntax:

osmjs -2 -m -l sparsetable -i osm2shape -j my_config.js some_osm_file.osm.pbf

You can define shapefiles like this:

    shapefile('pois').
        type(POINT).
        column('id', STRING, 12).
        column('type', STRING, 32).
        column('name', STRING, 32);

Note that each line ends in a dot (.), the last with a semikolon (;).

Types POINT, LINE, and POLYGON are allowed. You can use INTEGER, STRING,
DOUBLE, and BOOL as attribute types.

You can also define rules for matching OSM data to the right shapefiles:

    node('amenity', 'post_box|phone').
        output('pois').
            attr('type', 'amenity').
            attr('name');

This rule matches all nodes with a tag amenity=post_box or amenity=phone and
writes the node to the previously defined 'pois' shapefile. The 'id' attribute
is filled automatically with the id of the node. The 'type' attribute is filled
from the value of the tag with the key 'amenity' and the 'name' attribute is
filled from the value of the tag with the 'name' key.

You can match: node(), way(), area(). Areas can be closed simple ways or
multipolygons. The first argument to these matching functions is always a key.
The optional second argument is a value or list of values separated by '|'.
If the second argument is missing or '*', the rule matches all objects with
the given tag key regardless of the value.
