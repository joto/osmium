Osmium
======

http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmium

Osmium is a C++ framework for working with OSM data files. Osmium can read OSM
data in XML or binary format (PBF) and can call different handlers for each OSM
object.

Available handlers include:
* Javascript handler (calls Javascript callbacks you provide)
* Multipolygon handler (assembles multipolygons from relations and ways)
* NodeLocationStore handler (stores node locations and builds way geometries from them)
* Statistics handler (does some general statistics)

Of course, you can also write your own handlers.

There are a few applications that use Osmium in the examples directory.

Currently there are two major applications build on top of and available with Osmium:
* osmjs - calls your Javascript code, it can optionally assemble multipolygons for you
* tagstats - creates statistics about tags for Taginfo
             (distributed separately, see http://taginfo.openstreetmap.de/)

Note that OSM input files must contain objects in the right order for Osmium to
work properly: first nodes, then ways, then relations. Normally OSM files are
sorted this way, but if yours aren't, you can use Osmosis with the --sort
option to do this.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

Different parts of Osmium and the applications build on top of it need
different libraries:

zlib (for PBF support)
    http://www.zlib.net/
    Debian/Ubuntu: zlib1g zlib1g-dev

shapelib (for shapefile support in osmjs)
    http://shapelib.maptools.org/
    Debian/Ubuntu: libshp1 libshp-dev

libsqlite3 (for some applications only)
    http://sqlite.org/
    Debian/Ubuntu: libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev

libgd (for tagstats and nodedensity applications only)
    http://www.libgd.org/
    Debian/Ubuntu: libgd2-xpm libgd2-xpm-dev

Expat (for parsing XML files)
    http://expat.sourceforge.net/
    Debian/Ubuntu: libexpat1 libexpat1-dev

GEOS (for assembling multipolygons etc.)
    http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/
    Debian/Ubuntu: libgeos-3.2.0 (older versions might work) libgeos-dev

Google sparsehash
    http://code.google.com/p/google-sparsehash/
    Debian/Ubuntu: libsparsehash-dev

Google V8 Javascript engine (for Javascript support)
    http://code.google.com/apis/v8/
    Debian/Ubuntu: libv8-2.2.18 libv8-dev

LibICU (for UTF-8/UTF-16 conversion, only for Javascript support)
    http://site.icu-project.org/
    Debian/Ubuntu: libicu42 libicu-dev

Google protocol buffers (for PBF support)
    http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/ (at least Version 2.3.0 needed)
    (Debian/Ubuntu: libprotobuf6, libprotobuf-dev, protobuf-compiler)
    Also see http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PBF_Format

OSMPBF (for PBF support)
    https://github.com/joto/OSM-binary
    You need to build this first.

You need to either install the Debian/Ubuntu packages (or equivalent for other
distributions) or install those libraries from source. Most libraries should be
available in all distributions. The Google libs (V8, protobuf, sparsehash)
are only available in newer distributions (Ubuntu since Maverick).


FILES
-----

Doxyfile    - Needed for building the Osmium C++ docs, call "make doc" to build.
include     - C/C++ include files. All of Osmium is in those header files which
              are needed for building Osmium applications.
osmjs       - Osmium application "osmjs".
osmjs/js    - Example Javascript handlers.
examples    - Osmium example applications.


BUILDING
--------

First you need to (build and) install all the prerequisites.

To build everything just call "make" in the top-level directory. To build
only the osmjs or example application call "make" in those directories,
respectively.

Call "make clean" in any of those places to clean up.

Call "make doc" in the top-level directory to build the Osmium C++ docs.

Call "make install" to install osmjs. There is no install target for the
examplae applications.
