Osmium Examples
===============

This folder contains a number of example applications to demonstrate the
use of the Osmium framework for other developers.


FILES
-----

* nodedensity  
  This application will write a heatmap-like PNG to stdout based on the density
  of nodes in the supplied input file.

* osmium_convert  
  This application can be used to convert between the several OSM file formats
  like OSM (xml), gzip-compressed XML, bzip2-compressed XML and PBF.

* osmium_debug  
  This is a small tool to dump the contents of the input file.

* osmium_find_bbox  
  This is a small tool to find the bounding box of the input file.

* osmium_progress  
  This is a small tool demonstrating the use of the progress handler.

* osmium_range_from_history  
  Program to test the RangeFromHistory handler.

* osmium_sizeof  
  This is a small tool to find out the sizes of some basic classes.
  It is only used for Osmium development.

* osmium_stats  
  This is a small tool to try the Statistics handler.

* osmium_store_and_debug  
  This is a small tool to dump the contents of the input file.

* osmium_time  
  A small application that counts the various nodes, ways and relations in an
  input file and shows the time that it took to do that.

* osmium_toogr  
  This is an example tool that converts OSM data to a spatialite database using
  the OGR library.

* osmium_toogr2  
  This is an example tool that converts OSM data to a spatialite database using
  the OGR library. (This version creates multipolygons and reads the input file
  twice to do that.)

* osmium_toshape  
  An example application that converts any kind of OSM file into a set of
  shapefiles. It is filtering out highways as linestrings and postboxes as points.


BUILDING
--------

First you need to (build and) install all the prerequisites as mentioned in
the README file inside the main project folder.

To build the example applications go into the "examples" directory and
call "make".
